This Node.js script uses Puppeteer, Cheerio, and the File System (fs) module to scrape data from the Roku Channel's API. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Initialization: It launches a headless Chrome browser using Puppeteer and opens a new page for navigation.

2. Data Extraction Loop: The script iterates through specified pages (31 to 35) of the Roku Channel's API. For each page, it loads the content using Puppeteer, then parses the HTML using Cheerio to extract JSON data, which includes information about various movies or series.

3. Season Data Extraction: For each movie or series, the script fetches data for all available seasons by constructing and visiting specific API URLs. It then extracts detailed information about each season, including episodes.

4. Data Structuring: The extracted data is structured into a coherent format, encompassing series titles, descriptions, release dates, directors, and comprehensive season and episode details.

5. Error Handling: The script includes try-catch blocks to handle potential errors during scraping, ensuring stability and providing error logs for troubleshooting.

6. Data Saving: It appends the newly scraped data to existing data in 'show.json' if the file exists, or creates a new file if it doesn't. The final data is saved in JSON format.

7. Finalization: After scraping, the script closes the Puppeteer browser and completes the execution.

This script efficiently automates the process of collecting detailed content data from the Roku Channel, making it suitable for tasks like content analysis, cataloging, or aggregation.
